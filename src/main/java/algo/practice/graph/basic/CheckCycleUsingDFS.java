     * Use DFS. There must be a back edge ([i.e., a node points to one of its ancestors in a DFS tree] )
     * To detect a back edge, we need to keep track of the visited nodes that are in the current recursion stack.
     * use 3 colours - white(0), grey(1), black(2). (Alternatively, you can use two different flags : isVisited(), isInRecursionStack() )
     * - grey means being visited and part of the recursion stack.
     * - black means completed(visited and removed from recursion stack)
     * If there is a vertex that is referencing to some vertex in recursion stack, then this will be a back edge that forms a cycle.
     * all ancestors of a node are present in recursion call stack during DFS. So if there is an edge to an ancestor in DFS, then this is a back edge.
