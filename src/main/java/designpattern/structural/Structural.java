-- How to organize objects/classes? (composition/relationships)
-- To define class structure.

These Design Patterns  provide different ways to create a class structure,
for example using inheritance and composition to create a large object from small objects.

Solves: How to organize and relate classes/objects without making the system rigid or overly complicated.
This simplify relationships between entities and ensure reusability.
Examples:-
    Adapter (makes incompatible interfaces work together)
    Bridge (decouple abstraction from implementation)
    Composite (tree-like structure for part-whole hierarchy)
    Decorator (dynamically add responsibilities to objects)
    Facade (simplify a complex subsystem with one interface)
    Flyweight (share objects to reduce memory usage)
    Proxy (stand-in for another object)
