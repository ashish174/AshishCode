-- How do objects communicate? (interaction & responsibilities)

These Design patterns provide solution for the better interaction between objects
and how to provide loose coupling and flexibility to extend easily.

They focus on how objects communicate, collaborate, and distribute work.

What they solve: How to assign responsibilities among objects and manage the flow of control in complex systems.
Key idea: Define how objects interact in a flexible and loosely coupled way.
Examples:
    Observer (publish/subscribe mechanism)
    Strategy (define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable)
    Command (encapsulate a request as an object)
    Chain of Responsibility (pass requests along a chain of handlers)
    Mediator (centralize communication between objects)
    Memento (save and restore state)
    State (change behavior when internal state changes)
    Template Method (define skeleton of algorithm, let subclasses define steps)
    Visitor (separate algorithm from object structure)
    Interpreter, Iterator
