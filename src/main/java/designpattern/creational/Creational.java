-- How to create objects? (construction logic)
-- How Object creation/instantiation should happen in your codes.
-- Ensure object creation is decoupled from the actual instantiation logic.

these Design Pattern provide solution to instantiate a object
  in the best possible way for specific situations.


Examples:
    Singleton (only one instance of a class)
    Factory Method (subclasses decide which class to instantiate)
    Abstract Factory (creates families of related objects)
    Builder (constructs complex objects step by step)
    Prototype (clone an existing object instead of creating new)
