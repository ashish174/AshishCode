Code to Interface(Code in terms of Interfaces only)
  (Interface defines the contract for the implementation classes. ).
  Always go with interface because you donâ€™t have any default implementations.
  If we have some default implementation, then choose abstract class.
Prefer Composition over inheritance.
Loosely Coupled system instead of tightly coupled
   Tight coupling between implementation and the client code will be very hard to maintain and extend.
